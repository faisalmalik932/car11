          <h4>What should I do if the dealer does not have my exact vehicle?
</h4>
          <p>Dealers will nearly always do their best to ensure that they match your exact needs and specifications, but there are times when you may not directly find what interests you. This isn't the fault of the dealer in any way as there may be limited colors, models, as well as other parameters of what you seek.
If a situation like this arises, the best thing is to be patient and cooperate well with the dealer and try to work out the best option or alternative for you.
